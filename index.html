<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>This is my website! I hope you enjoy the content and that I get full points on my assignment!</p>

<h2>A Little About Me</h2>

<p>I'm a TWC major with an IT and Design subplan. I'm a first semester senior and will be graduating next spring. I'm VERY ready for graduation.
 I have a part time job working with elementary age students and I also work for a high school study abroad company in the summers. It allows
me to be able to travel around the world on a student budget! I'm also a speech coach for a local high school.</p>

<h2>Fun Facts</h2>

<p>I'm afraid of escalators<br>
My favorite animal is a frog<br>
My favorite color is green</p>
